# Sound Angle Estimation by Fusion of Gaussian Mixture Model and Multiple Signal classification

This is a C++ library for one-dimensional direction-of-arrival (sound direction) estimation method.
We employs a Gaussian mixture model with a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm and MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm.
The idea can be found in the following paper; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318555734_Multiple_Frequency_and_Source_Angle_Estimation_by_Gaussian_Mixture_Model_with_Modified_Microphone_Array_Data_Model.
Note that microphones are arranged in a one straight line.

Enjoy!
